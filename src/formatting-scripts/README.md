# Formatting Script

Converts all .continuous/.events files into .npz files recursively. Converter module 'OpenEphys.py' taken from https://github.com/open-ephys/analysis-tools.

## Usage

Place both files in the same directory as the experiment data directories (e.g. same directory as Exp 1).
Run main.py and edit the .continuous/.events and experimentPath as desired.
